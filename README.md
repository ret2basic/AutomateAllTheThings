# AutomateAllTheThings

This project contains a series of smaller projects I built when I was learning automated binary analysis. The topics include fuzzing, dynamic taint analysis, symbolic execution, and etc. Specifically, this project includes the following parts:

- angr-ctf: learn angr by solving a series of CTF challenges.
- afl-training: explore various afl techniques by fuzzing a series of binaries.
- backward-slicer: a backward slicing tool built upon Triton.
