# AutomateAllTheThings

This project contains a series of smaller projects I built when I was learning automated binary analysis. The topics include fuzzing, dynamic taint analysis, symbolic execution, and etc. Specifically, this project includes the following parts:

- **Fuzzing 101:** learn AFL++ by fuzzing real-world applications.
- **angr-ctf:** learn angr by solving a series of CTF challenges.
