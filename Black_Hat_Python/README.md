# Black Hat Python

## Motivation

The network is and always will be the sexiest arena for a hacker. An attacker can do almost anything with simple network access, such as scan for hosts, inject packets. sniff data, and remotely exploit hosts. But if you've worked your way into the deepest depths of an enterprise target, you may find yourself in a bit of a conundrum: you have no tools to execute network attacks. No netcat. No Wiresharak. No compiler, and no means to install one. However, you might be surprised to find that in many cases, you'll have a Python install. So that's where we'll begin.
