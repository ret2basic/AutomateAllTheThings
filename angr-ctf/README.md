# angr-ctf

Learning angr is hard, and a CTF might make the learning process easier for you CTF maniacs. The challenge binaries come from this project:

https://github.com/jakespringer/angr_ctf

Each level contains the following files:

1. A x86 binary that asks for a password. If the password is correct, it prints "Good job.". Otherwise, it prints "Try again.". Our objective is to find the correct password using angr.
2. A Python script named "scaffold.py". This is the skeleton solution script. Start here and complete its logic.
3. A Python script named "solve.py". This is the final solution script. Only look at it when you get stuck for too long.
